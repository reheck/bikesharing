# Bikesharing
## Overview and Purpose
### The purpose of this project is to provide data and appropriate visualizations to convince investors that a bikesharing program would be profitable in Des Moines, Iowa. CitiBike data was pulled from their data base from August 2019 in NYC where there currently is a successful bikesharing program. Important information was gleaned from the data and supportive visualizations were created using Tableau Public.
## Results
### User Types
#### The most common usertype for the bikesharing program is the subscriber. See Figure 1.

### Starting and Ending Locations
#### The starting and ending locations are generally confined to one section of NYC and the start and end locations seem highly similar. This potentially means that users do not travel far when they use the bikes. Since the majority of users are subscribers, it is likely the starting and ending locations are places where subscribers need to travel to and from, rather than travelling for pleasure or sight seeing. See Figure 2 for Starting locations, and Figure 3 for Ending locations.

### Trip Duration
#### The trip duration overall is less than 45 minutes. See Figure 4.

#### When the trip duration is broken down by gender, the overall trip is still less than 45 mintues, but it is noticable that more men than women use the bikes for these short trips. See Figure 5.

### Trips by Weekday and Hour

#### The most common times that bikes are used are on the weekdays during the morning and evening work commute hours of 6am to 10am and 4pm to 8pm. See Figure 6.

### Trips by Weekday and Hour per Gender

#### Breaking down the trips by weekday and hour into how they differ by gender reveals again that more men than women use the bikes during the commuting hours. However, it is still apparent that the most populous times for bike useage, regardless of gender, is during the commuting hours of 6am to 10am and 4pm to 8pm. See Figure 7.

### User Type Trips (Weekday, Hour, and Gender)

#### Looking at the visualization, it is clear that male subscribers are the most frequent users of the bikesharing program. Furthermore, it is clear that Thursdays are the absolute heaviest day for bike users. Taking a short glance at the "customer" user section of this visualization, it is clear that "customers" or the occaisional users will use bikes any given day and are neither more likely to be male nor female. These users are likely vacationers with no real set agenda unlike the subscribers who are obviously using the bikes to commute to work. See Figure 8.

### Bike Repair

#### The bike repair visualization does not tell much just by looking at the color gradient, but it can help pinpoint which bikes, based on their ID's when hovering over a box, needs repaired first. The darker the color on the treemap, the more times the bike has been used and therefore the higher likelihood it needs maintenance first before other bikes. See Figure 9. This information is very important for ensuring bikes are in good working condition for commuters. Also, based on the information gathered from the trips by weekday and hour, the best time for repair would be from 12am to 4am any day of the week. Additionaly, it is of the utmost importance that bikes are repaired Thursday mornings so that there are plenty of bikes for the Thursday commute. The information in the trips by weekday and hour visualizations show that Thursdays are the busiest use days for bikes.

## Summary
### Overall, the NYC bike sharing program seems most profitable for subscribers who use the bikes during their morning and evening commutes to work during the work week. Therefore, a similar bike sharing program focused on gaining and retaining subscribers from the Des Moines, IA business district would be a most profitable endeavor.
### Another visualization that could be made to further support the success of a bike sharing program in Des Moines, IA based on the success of the one in NYC would be to view the age and gender of subscribers taking the trips during the morning and evening commuter hours. Further breaking down the subscriber data, it would be useful to see the most popular starting and ending stations used by subscribers during the commuting hours. A map visualization based on the number of trips from each starting location filtered by only subscribers may provide this insight. These visualizations would provide further evidence to suggest that a commuter bike sharing program would be profitable in Des Moines, IA as it is in NYC.
